    <p> neXt is my nonprofit organization which aims to close inequities in the education system. It provides personalized, continuous, and accessible learning opportunities through an app that I programmed, a website that I created, and neXt’s tutors. I founded this organization because of my first-hand experiences with the large systemic divide that oppresses disadvantaged and struggling students. </p>

    </a>
    <p class="experience"> I’m the Director of Community Outreach and the head of the Student Accessibility bill group for the Washington State Legislative Youth Advisory Council. As Director, I spearheaded our council’s efforts to incorporate the diverse perspectives of Washington’s young people into our legislative work. I led the 2021 Washington Youth Survey, the Legislative Process and Youth Civic Engagement Town Hall, the 2021 Virtual Action Day, connecting with nearly 200 youth organizations, presenting at events hosted by the Tacoma Mayor’s Youth Commission, League of Education Voters, and more, as well as partnering with the Washington State Board of Education, Ready WA, WSSDA, and more. The council’s legislative work under my leadership also included conceiving and passing into law House Bill 1373, which mandates that all schools must share information about mental health resources. I personally lobbied legislators, met with state officials, and testified in committee on endorsed legislation. </p>

    </a>
    <p class="experience"> I’m going into my fourth year as a Youth Ambassador for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Discovery Center. I helped to co-curate the We The Future Exhibition at the Gates Foundation Discovery Center. I created toolkits for visitors, and led community discussions with visitors while they could visit in-person. I’ve also created and hosted three Teen Action Fairs with my fellow youth ambassadors. I was a speaker on the In Community We Flourish series and was spotlighted in the Enduring COVID-19 exhibition at the Discovery Center. </p>
